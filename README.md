# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles for my WezTerm + Fish + Neovim (LazyVim) development setup. Feel free to clone or steal.

> I decided to go down the NeoVim rabbit-hole early December 2023 after seeing some really pretty setups on YouTube. I gave LunarVim a try in November 2023 very unsuccessfully, but the second time around I chose LazyVim and fell in love.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

You will first need to install some prerequisites for LazyVim:

```bash
brew install neovim
brew install lazygit

# for telescope
brew install ripgrep
brew install fd
```

From there, you will need [Fish Shell](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell).

```
brew install fish
brew install fisher

# install fisher plugins
fisher update

# add homebrew to path
fish_add_path /opt/homebrew/bin

# set up fish as default shell
echo "/opt/homebrew/bin/fish" | sudo tee -a /etc/shells
chsh -s /opt/homebrew/bin/fish
```

After installing the above, you will just need [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html).

### SymLink Configs

After installing the above prerequisites, you can clone this repo somewhere and then make symbolic links to the directories in `.config` like so:

```bash
ln -s $HOME/GitHub/personal/dotfiles/.config/fish $HOME/.config/fish
ln -s $HOME/GitHub/personal/dotfiles/.config/nvim $HOME/.config/nvim
ln -s $HOME/GitHub/personal/dotfiles/.config/wezterm $HOME/.config/wezterm
```
